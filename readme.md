I've always loved my articluted desk lamp, and been fascinated by it's movement system. Recreating the lamp seemed like a great excercise in linkage design and sheet metal fabrication.
So I made this- the most over engineered desk lamp I've ever seen. Here's why- 
Uses ultralight carbon fiber rods(cause it can), connected with laser cut alluminum brackets. 
And of course it is controlled with a capactive touch button concealed under the 3d printed lamp shade. Oh, and did I mention it has homekit support?
